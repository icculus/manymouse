ManyMouse's website is http://icculus.org/manymouse/

This is a simple library to abstract away the reading of multiple input
 devices. It is designed to work cross-platform.

Just copy all of the C files and headers in this directory into your
 project, and build the C files. Unless explicitly noted, you shouldn't have
 to #define anything, and each file is wrapped in #ifdefs to avoid compiling
 on the wrong platforms, so it is safe to build everything without close
 examination.

You don't have to build this as a shared library; we encourage you to just
 compile the source and statically link them into your application...this
 makes integrating ManyMouse much less complex.

The "example" directory contains complete programs to demostrate the use of
 the ManyMouse API in action. These files don't need to be copied into your
 project, but you can cut-and-paste their contents as needed.

Basic usage:
 - Copy *.c and *.h from the base of the manymouse folder to your project.
 - Add the new files to your project's build system.
 - #include "manymouse.h" in your source code
 - Call ManyMouse_Init() once before using anything else in the library,
   usually at program startup time. If it returns > 0, it found mice it can
   use.
 - Call ManyMouse_DeviceName() if you want to know the human-readable
   name of each device ("Logitech USB mouse", etc).
 - Read input from the mice with ManyMouse_PollEvent() in a loop until the
   function returns 0. Each time through the loop, examine the event that
   was returned and react appropriately. Do this with regular frequency:
   generally, a good rule is to poll for ManyMouse events at the same time
   you poll for other system GUI events...once per iteration of your
   program's main loop.
 - When you are done processing mice, call ManyMouse_Quit() once, usually at
   program termination.

There are examples of complete usage in the "example" directory.

The test apps on Linux and MacOS X can be built by running "make" from a
 terminal. The SDL test app will fail if Simple Directmedia Layer
 (http://libsdl.org/) isn't installed. The stdio apps will still work.

Windows isn't integrated into the Makefile, since most people will want to
 put it in a VS.NET project anyhow, but here's the command line used to
 build some of the standalone test apps:

cl /I. *.c example\test_manymouse_stdio.c /Fetest_manymouse_stdio.exe
cl /I. *.c example\detect_mice.c /Fedetect_mice.exe

(yes, that's simple, that's the point)...getting the SDL test app to work
 on Windows can be done, but takes too much effort unrelated to ManyMouse
 itself for this document to explain.


Java bindings:
 There are now Java bindings available in the contrib/java directory.
  They should work on any platform that ManyMouse supports that has a Java
  virtual machine. If you're using the makefile, you can run "make java" and
  it will produce the native code glue library and class files that you can
  include in your application. Please see contrib/java/TestManyMouse.java
  for an example of how to use ManyMouse from your Java application. Most
  of this documentation talks about the C interface to ManyMouse, but with
  minor modifications also applies to the Java bindings. We welcome patches
  and bug reports on the Java bindings, but don't officially support them.

  Thanks to Brian Ballsun-Stanton for kicking this into gear.


Some notes:
 - If a mouse is disconnected, it will not return future events, even if you
   plug it right back in. You will be alerted of disconnects programmatically
   through the MANYMOUSE_EVENT_DISCONNECT event, which will be the last
   event sent for the disconnected device. You can safely redetect all mice by
   calling ManyMouse_Quit() followed by ManyMouse_Init(), but be warned that
   this may cause mice (even ones that weren't unplugged) to suddenly have a
   different device index, since on most systems, the replug will cause the
   mouse to show up elsewhere in the system's USB device tree. It is
   recommended that you make redetection an explicit user-requested function
   for this reason.

 - In most systems, all mice will control the same system cursor. It's
   recommended that you ask your window system to grab the mouse input to your
   application and hide the system cursor, and then do all mouse input
   processing through ManyMouse. Most GUI systems will continue to deliver
   mouse events through the system cursor even when ManyMouse is working; in
   these cases, you should continue to read the usual GUI system event queue,
   for the usual reasons, and just throw away the mouse events, which you
   instead grab via ManyMouse_PollEvent(). Hiding the system cursor will mean
   that you may need to draw your own cursor in an app-specific way, but
   chances are you need to do that anyhow if you plan to support multiple
   mice. Grabbing the input means preventing other apps from getting mouse
   events, too, so you'll probably need to build in a means to ungrab the
   mouse if the user wants to, say, respond to an instant message window or
   email...again, you will probably need to do this anyhow.

 - On Windows, ManyMouse requires Windows XP or later to function, since it
   relies on APIs that are new to XP...it uses LoadLibrary() on User32.dll and
   GetProcAddress() to get all the Windows entry points it uses, so on pre-XP
   systems, it will run, but fail to find any mice in ManyMouse_Init().
   ManyMouse does not require a window to run, and can even be used by console
   (stdio) applications. Please note that using DirectInput at the same time
   as ManyMouse can cause problems; ManyMouse does not use DirectInput, due
   to DI8's limitations, but its parallel use seems to prevent ManyMouse from
   getting mouse input anyhow. This is mostly not an issue, but users of
   Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL, http://libsdl.org/) may find that it uses
   DirectInput behind the scenes. We are still researching the issue, but we
   recommend using SDL's "windib" target in the meantime to avoid this
   problem.

 - (XInput code isn't finished yet, but in the future this note will be true.)
   On Unix systems, we try to use the XInput extension if possible...currently
   most users (XFree86/x.org X server) will not find this useful, since XInput
   is either not included or not configured properly. In the short term, most
   Linux users should favor the evdev target, below. For now, the XInput
   target will refuse to work unless it sees more than one mouse, since in
   those cases, the system is possibly misconfigured. XInput currently doesn't
   support hotplugging, although the x.org people are planning to extend the
   spec to support this. If you want to use the XInput target, make sure you
   link with "-ldl", since we use dlopen() to find the X11/XInput libraries.
   You do not have to link against Xlib directly, and ManyMouse will fail
   gracefully (reporting no mice in the ManyMouse XInput driver) if the
   libraries don't exist on the end user's system. Naturally, you'll need
   the X11 headers on your system. You can build with SUPPORT_XINPUT defined
   to zero to disable XInput support.

 - On Linux, we first try to use the /dev/input/event* devices; this means
   that ManyMouse can function with or without an X server. Please note that
   the next major release of x.org's X server will grab the devices at the
   kernel level, and will make this interface useless...eventually, their
   XInput implementation will implement hotplugging and such, making it the
   favorable ManyMouse target for most Linux users.

 - On MacOS X, we use IOKit's HID Manager API, which means you can use this
   C-callable library from Cocoa, Carbon, and generic Unix applications, with
   or without a GUI. There are Java bindings available, too, letting you use
   ManyMouse from any of the official Mac application layers. This code may or
   may not work on Darwin (we're not sure if IOKit is available to that
   platform); reports of success are welcome. If you aren't already, you will
   need to make sure you link against the "Carbon" and "IOKit" frameworks once
   you add ManyMouse to your project.

 - Support for other platforms than MacOS X, Linux, and Windows is not planned,
   but contributions of implementations for other platforms are welcome.
